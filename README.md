<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to making a decision regarding the travel agency, you must choose the&nbsp;most suitable type of&nbsp;<em>tour .&nbsp;</em>Because the Grand Canyon is so vast, it's impossible to see everything in one trip, so you'll want to select the items that are most interesting to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, think about perspective: Would you rather see the Canyon from above or below?&nbsp;A plane tour could take you across the entire Canyon so you can fully appreciate its vastness.&nbsp;A helicopter tour would allow you to see some of the Canyon from above, but it can also go down and let you see the Canyon walls and even land in designated areas.&nbsp;Rustic vehicles, buses, and walking tours can take you to some of the most stunningly beautiful and famous scenery in the Canyon, offering less breadth but greater depth than air tours.&nbsp;Finally, there are some&nbsp;<em>rafting tours </em>and hiking trails that will allow you to see the Canyon from its heart, you will have a much smaller perspective, limited by the massive walls on each side, but it will give you the opportunity to spend more time exploring the secrets of the Canyon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, what about the other things you want from this trip.&nbsp;Are you visiting the Canyon simply to appreciate its grandeur and majesty, or is a need for physical fitness and adventure included in your dream? Would you like to learn about the history of the Canyon, its ecology, geology, etc.?&nbsp;Think about the nature of your tour: you might prefer large groups filled with potentially new friends, or small groups that favor a more intimate experience.&nbsp;Some tours are relaxing, giving you a chance to soak up your surroundings.&nbsp;Others are faster, moving from one activity to another in order to experience as much of the Canyon as possible.&nbsp;Be sure to consider your most important preferences when making a selection from the categories below:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Types of Tours&nbsp;</strong><strong>in the Grand&nbsp;</strong><strong>Canyon</strong></h3>
<div class="one-half first" style="text-align: justify;">
<h5>Helicopter tours</h5>
<p>Like air tours, helicopter tours will show you the Grand Canyon from a new perspective.&nbsp;Tour helicopters typically don't fly as fast or as far as airplanes;&nbsp;however, they can fly lower.&nbsp;Many helicopter tours can go down to the edge of the Canyon;&nbsp;some can even land in the Canyon!</p>
<h5>Bus tours</h5>
<p>Bus tours can be a cheaper alternative to plane or helicopter tours.&nbsp;They're slower, which means you'll spend more time on the trail &ndash; and therefore more time to enjoy the amazing scenery of the Grand Canyon too!&nbsp;Most bus tours allow you to stop to walk around and take pictures at a number of selected points.</p>
<h5>Hiking tours</h5>
<p>Some say that you haven't truly experienced the Grand Canyon until you've tested yourself by climbing up and down its walls!&nbsp;Hiking tours can range from strenuous trails for those who love to test their athleticism, to more relaxed trails along the rim of the Canyon and past various scenic spots.</p>
<h5>Tours in rustic vehicles</h5>
<p>Like bus tours, rustic vehicles allow you to see as much of the Grand Canyon (from the ground, of course) as possible, driving you along the rim and stopping at great stops.&nbsp;An open vehicle allows you to experience all the sights and sounds of the Canyon without any barriers!</p>

<div class="one-half">
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Air tours</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's hard to appreciate the scope and scale of the Grand Canyon from below, or even from its highest point.&nbsp;On a plane tour, you can fly through the entire Canyon, fully appreciating its vastness.&nbsp;Tour planes are designed with wings on top and large, flat windows to improve visual ability and make it easier to take pictures.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Rafting Tours</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Probably one of the most exciting adventures: rafting tours on the white waters of the Colorado River, the walls of the Grand Canyon will rise on both sides!&nbsp;Rafting/camping tours last for days or even weeks and adhere to strict conservation regulations, so you definitely have to have some wild instincts in your spirit&hellip;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Combination tours</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combination tours allow you to completely shape your Grand Canyon experience.&nbsp;Want to get from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon on a plane, fly over and down the Canyon in a helicopter, have lunch, then maybe go horseback riding, do some&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>rafting</em>&nbsp;, hiking, etc? ?&nbsp;No problem!</p>
